# 0.1-alpha - Apr 27, 2023

This is the first alpha release of LDK Node. It features support for sourcing
chain data via an Esplora server, filesystem persistence, gossip sourcing via
the Lightning peer-to-peer network, and configurble entropy sources for the
integrated LDK and BDK-based wallets.

Note that this release is still considered experimental, should not be run in
production, and no compatibility guarantees are given until the release of 0.1.
